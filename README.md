Project Components
1. Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is sourced from either internal business data or publicly available datasets.
It includes data related to sales, customer demographics, inventory, etc.
2. Data Preparation
Data cleaning and transformation steps were performed using Power Query Editor in Power BI to handle missing values, rename columns, and ensure data consistency.
3. Data Modeling
Relationships between tables were established to create a star schema model.
Calculated fields and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures were created to perform calculations like Total Sales, Average Order Value, and Profit Margin.
4. Dashboard Design
The dashboard consists of multiple interactive visualizations:
Bar and Line Charts: Show trends over time.
Pie Charts: Represent category-wise distribution.
KPIs: Display critical metrics such as Total Revenue, Customer Count, and Average Sales.
Slicers: Allow users to filter the data by time periods, regions, and other relevant parameters.
5. Key Insights
Sales Trends: Analysis of sales performance over time.
Top Products: Best-selling products by revenue.
Customer Segmentation: Analysis of new versus returning customers.
Profit Margins: A detailed breakdown of profit generated per category.
